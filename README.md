# Welcome to my CLI bamazon Node application

# For this you will need to run npm install to install the needed node packages

# For bamazonCustomer.js you will be prompted for an item roduct id and a quantity for your order

# Once you enter this information, if there is enough stock the database will be updated with quantity appropriatly according to your order.

# If there is not enough stock you will be presented with a message that states there is insufficient quantity to fufill your order.

# In both of the above cases you will need to run the application again if you wish to order another item.

# NOTE: You will need to run the sql scripts in mysql workbench for this to work.

# Thanks!
